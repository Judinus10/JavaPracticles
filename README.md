## üìñ About the Project  

This project contains three packages, **Loops**, **Intro**, and **Arrays**, each designed to help beginners practice core Java concepts such as loops, conditional statements, arrays, and input/output operations. The exercises cover real-world scenarios like factorials, Fibonacci sequences, array operations, and simple patterns.

## üì¶ Packages and Classes  

### **Package: Loops**  
Contains exercises to master looping constructs (`for` and `while`).  

1. **`EvenAndOdd.java`**  
   - Find and print all even or odd numbers between 1 and 50 using both `for` and `while` loops.  

2. **`Factorials.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for a number and calculate its factorial using both `for` and `while` loops.  

3. **`NumberPrint.java`**  
   - Print numbers from 1 to 10 using both `for` and `while` loops.  

4. **`Sum.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for a number `n` and calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using both `for` and `while` loops.  

5. **`FibonacciSequence.java `**
   - Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
   
6.  **`MultiplicationTable.java `**
   - Generate and print the multiplication table of a number entered by the user.

7. **`ReverseNumber.java `**
   - Reverse the digits of a given integer using a loop.

8. **`PrimeNumberCheck.java `**
   - Check if a number is prime or not.

9. **`CountDigits.java `**
   - Count the number of digits in an integer.

10. **`SumOfDigits.java `**
    - Calculate the sum of the digits of a number.

### **Package: Intro**  
Contains basic introductory programs covering conditional logic, simple patterns, and input/output.  

1. **`EvenNumbers.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for a number and check if it is even or odd using a `for` loop.  

2. **`Greeting.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for their name and display a greeting message.  

3. **`SumTwoNumbers.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for two numbers and display their sum.  

4. **`Asterisks1.java`**  
   - Print a pattern of asterisks (`*`), such as a triangle or square.  

5. **`NumberClarification.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for a number and determine if it is even, odd, or zero using a `for` loop and `if` statements.  

---

### **Package: Arrays**  
Contains exercises to practice array operations such as summation, finding max/min, and searching elements.  

1. **`Sum.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for an array length and elements, then calculate and display the sum of the elements.  

2. **`FindMaxAndMin.java`**  
   - Find and print the maximum and minimum elements of a user-defined array.  

3. **`PrintArray2.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for an array and display its elements in a formatted manner.  

4. **`PrintArray1.java`**  
   - Demonstrates two methods to print a pre-defined array using `for` and `for-each` loops.  

5. **`SearchElement.java`**  
   - Search for a specific element in a pre-defined array based on user input.  

6. **`ReverseArray.java`**
   - Reverse the elements of an array using a loop.
   
7. `**CountEvenOdd.java`**
   - Count how many even and odd numbers are present in an array.
   
8. `**BubbleSort.java`**
   - Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.
   
9. `**FindSecondLargest.java`**
   - Find the second largest number in an array without sorting.

## üìñ About the Project  

This project contains multiple packages that cover a variety of Java exercises. The exercises include loops, arrays, and multithreading concepts. Each exercise is designed to help you enhance your problem-solving skills and understanding of core Java.

## üì¶ Packages and Classes  

### **Package: Loops**  
Contains exercises to master looping constructs (`for` and `while`).  

1. **`EvenAndOdd.java`**  
   - Find and print all even or odd numbers between 1 and 50 using both `for` and `while` loops.  

2. **`Factorials.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for a number and calculate its factorial using both `for` and `while` loops.  

3. **`NumberPrint.java`**  
   - Print numbers from 1 to 10 using both `for` and `while` loops.  

4. **`Sum.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for a number `n` and calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using both `for` and `while` loops.  

5. **`FibonacciSequence.java `**
   - Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
   
6.  **`MultiplicationTable.java `**
   - Generate and print the multiplication table of a number entered by the user.

7. **`ReverseNumber.java `**
   - Reverse the digits of a given integer using a loop.

8. **`PrimeNumberCheck.java `**
   - Check if a number is prime or not.

9. **`CountDigits.java `**
   - Count the number of digits in an integer.

10. **`SumOfDigits.java `**
    - Calculate the sum of the digits of a number.

### **Package: Arrays**  
Contains exercises to practice array operations such as summation, finding max/min, and searching elements.  

1. **`Sum.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for an array length and elements, then calculate and display the sum of the elements.  

2. **`FindMaxAndMin.java`**  
   - Find and print the maximum and minimum elements of a user-defined array.  

3. **`PrintArray2.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for an array and display its elements in a formatted manner.  

4. **`PrintArray1.java`**  
   - Demonstrates two methods to print a pre-defined array using `for` and `for-each` loops.  

5. **`SearchElement.java`**  
   - Search for a specific element in a pre-defined array based on user input.  

6. **`ReverseArray.java`**  
   - Reverse the elements of an array using a loop.  

7. **`CountEvenOdd.java`**  
   - Count how many even and odd numbers are present in an array.  

8. **`BubbleSort.java`**  
   - Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.  

9. **`FindSecondLargest.java`**  
   - Find the second largest number in an array without sorting.

### **Package: Thread**  
Contains exercises to practice multithreading concepts such as thread creation, synchronization, and concurrent tasks.  

#### **Classes**  
1. **`CreateThread1.java`**  
   - Demonstrates thread creation by extending the `Thread` class.  

2. **`CreateThread2.java`**  
   - Demonstrates thread creation by implementing the `Runnable` interface.  

3. **`CreateThread3.java`**  
   - Demonstrates thread creation using a lambda function.  

#### **Sub-Package: HusbandWife**  
Simulates a real-world scenario where multiple threads (husband and wife) access a common bank account.  

1. **`BankAccount.java`**  
   - Represents a shared bank account with synchronized methods to ensure thread safety.  

2. **`Husband.java`**  
   - A thread class that simulates a husband withdrawing money from the account.  

3. **`Wife.java`**  
   - A thread class that simulates a wife depositing money into the account.  

4. **`Main.java`**  
   - The main driver class to execute the threads and simulate concurrent access to the shared bank account.

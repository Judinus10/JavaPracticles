## üìñ About the Project

This project contains two packages, **Loops** and **Intro**, each designed to help beginners practice core Java concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and input/output operations. The exercises cover real-world scenarios like factorials, Fibonacci sequences, and simple patterns.

---

## üì¶ Packages and Classes

### **Package: Loops**
Contains exercises to master looping constructs (`for` and `while`).

1. **`EvenAndOdd.java`**  
   - Find and print all even or odd numbers between 1 and 50 using both `for` and `while` loops.

2. **`Factorials.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for a number and calculate its factorial using both `for` and `while` loops.

3. **`NumberPrint.java`**  
   - Print numbers from 1 to 10 using both `for` and `while` loops.

4. **`Sum.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for a number `n` and calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using both `for` and `while` loops.

---

### **Package: Intro**
Contains basic introductory programs covering conditional logic, simple patterns, and input/output.

1. **`EvenNumbers.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for a number and check if it is even or odd using a `for` loop.

2. **`Fibonacci.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for a number and print the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number using a `for` loop.

3. **`Greeting.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for their name and display a greeting message.

4. **`SumTwoNumbers.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for two numbers and display their sum.

5. **`Asterisks1.java`**  
   - Print a pattern of asterisks (`*`), such as a triangle or square.

6. **`NumberClarification.java`**  
   - Prompt the user for a number and determine if it is even, odd, or zero using a `for` loop and `if` statements.
